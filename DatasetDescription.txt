1. Title of Database: Flood Prediction Data

2. Sources:
	(a) Origin owners Of Database:
	Department of Computer Application
	National Institute Of Technology, Raipur

	(b) Donor of database:
		Parvesh Bansal(MCA 3rd year NIT , Raipur parveshbansal47535@gmail.com)

3. Past Usage:
	Dataset was used in National Science Exhibhition,Avartan(Techfest Of NIT,Raipur)
	

4. Relevant Information Paragraph:

   Dataset can be used to train the Machine Learning model which will
   predict chance of flood or not based on the values 
   of 2 parametrs.  

   From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
   majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
   continuous values have been scaled.
6. Number of Attributes: 3

7. Attribute information:
   Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a
   brief description.  The number of class is the value to predict: either
   as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

	Name		Data Type	Meas.	Description
	----		---------	-----	-----------
	Flowrate  		Continious	Hr/ltr	Water flowrate measure by flowrate sensor
	WaterLevel	Continious	Cm	Level of water at dam measure by Ultrasonic sensor
	Y (class)		Range(0-3)		0 for no chance of flood,1 indicates low level flood,2indicates medium level flood chance,3 								indicates high level flood
