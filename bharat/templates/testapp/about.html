<h1><center>About the Project</h1>
<center>Accurate prediction of flood water level is extremely importance as an early warning system to the public to inform them about the possible incoming flood disaster.</center>	
Using the collected data at source from river stations and inner conditions of Dam, and weather forecast, this project propose a model for prediction and detection<br>
of flood and using alarming system to aware people about it by displaying turning on siren and displaying alert on our official website.
<p><center>The main objective of this project is to leverage the existing technology to analyse the various environment variables and give an reliable response variable </center>
which could predict the time and intensity of the flood and aware people about it well before. 

<br>
<br>
<h1><center>Methodology of the System</h1>
<center>This project implements Supervised Learning. Various dependent variables are collected through though sensors sensors which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors</center>(independent variables)
<center>This project mainly uses two sensors for reading the environment variables.An ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level of the Dam and YF-S201 Sensor </center>
sensor is used to measure the rate of flow of the river corresponding to it.
<p> Both these sensors are used to collect data and store it in database with various other parameters. These variables are analysed altogether by against a dataset(designed by us)<br>
using an appropriate Machine Learning Algorithm for flood forecasting.
<br>
<br>
<h1><center>Future Work</center></h1>
<center>This project is split into two distinct sections, one measuring environmental variables and one dealing with analysis. Our future works includes adding rainfall measurement</center>
sensor and weather forecasting for better collection of data, and applying ANN on dataset for even better prediction.
